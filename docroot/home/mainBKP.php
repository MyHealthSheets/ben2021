		 <div class="card-body">
		          <p class="card-text">I have always been interesting in Electronics and Computers. It probably started in my pre-teens, taking apart mine (and my family's) Electronic Devices to try and understand them better.
		              I often left them in pieces or put back together with one or more parts missing. I think partly seeing these boxes of broken Electronics is what ultimately helped me decide to go to college and graduate with an Electronics Technologist Diploma. 
		          </p>
		          <p>
		              From there I worked in various industries utilizing these skills until realizing what I really
		              wanted to do was work with Computers and Computer Software.
		          </p>
		          <p>
		            I received my Software Programming Diploma in 2012 and have been continuing to learn new technologies every
		            opportunity I get.
		          </p>
		        <p>	
		            The Electronics industry has changed consderably since I graduated in 2004, and this was the dawn of IoT technologies
		            and SoC circuits like Arduino and picoPY. I have created simple LED lights working with sensors and timers, and more complex
		            projects with Bluetooth and Audio Amplifiers. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            For a more fullstack programming experience I have created many projects with SBC's, like the Raspberry Pi. I have 
		            projects ranging from a Car Entertainment System, Open Source Home Automation Software, Drupal and PHP Web Applications, along
		            with many others. The Raspberry Pi has also allowed me to work through the Command Line and making sure my skills don't 
		            get forgetten.
