							I have backgrounds in both Electronics and Computer Programming. 

							I do my best to keep up with and learn new technologies, and am always working on 
							projects in my spare time to achieve this. I spent several years developing an Android Application,
							"MyHealthSheets". In order to get more familiar with other programming languages and frameworks, I have redeveloped 
							this Android App and used it as a skeleton for other projects.

							I continue working on a variety Electronics projects, and with the advent of IoT technologies have been
							able to combine my two passions of Electronics and Development. I have an arsenal of Arduino, ESP32, SMC's, and Electronics 
							Components to work with.

							My other projects revolve around Web Servers, both on the cloud and utilizing hardware like the Raspberry Pi.
