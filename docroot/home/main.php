						<p class="card-text">I have always been interesting in Electronics and Computers. It probably started in my pre-teens, taking apart mine (and my family's) Electronic Devices to try and understand them better.
							I often left them in pieces or put back together with one or more parts missing. I think partly seeing these boxes of broken Electronics is what ultimately helped me decide to go to college and graduate with an Electronics Technologist Diploma. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From there I worked in various industries utilizing these skills until realizing what I really
							wanted to do was work with Computers and Computer Software.
						</p>
						<p>
							I received my Software Programming Diploma in 2012 and have been continuing to learn new technologies every
							opportunity I get.
						</p>
						<p>	
							The Electronics industry has changed consderably since I graduated in 2004, and this was the dawn of IoT technologies
							and SoC circuits like Arduino and picoPY. I have created simple LED lights working with sensors and timers, and more complex
							projects with Bluetooth and Audio Amplifiers. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For a more fullstack programming experience I have created many projects with SBC's, like the Raspberry Pi. I have 
							projects ranging from a Car Entertainment System, Open Source Home Automation Software, Drupal and PHP Web Applications, along
							with many others. The Raspberry Pi has also allowed me to work through the Command Line and making sure my skills don't 
							get forgetten.

							<h5>Personal PHP Web site projects </h5>
							<p>I have been developing a couple PHP based Web sites/applications for practice.
							This site is a simple PHP application, however I also have a demo Web Application for myhealthsheets.com. I do most of my dev work on my Raspberry Pi, then push this to a Web Server when ready for production.

							<h5>RetroPIE - EmulationStation for Raspberry Pi</h5>
							<p>This turns any Raspi into a retro-gaming machine. Allows you to play just about
							all retro gaming consoles through your raspberry Pi.This is a fun project that you can
							also setup with NES or other type cases and utilize BT joysticks that look like
							retro controllers.
