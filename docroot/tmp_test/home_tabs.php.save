				<h5>Personal PHP Web site projects </h5>
				<p>I have been developing a couple PHP based Web sites/applications for practice.
				This site is a simple PHP application, however I also have a demo Web Application for myhealthsheets.com. I do most of my dev work on my Raspberry Pi, then push this to a Web Server when ready for production.

                 	<h5>RetroPIE - EmulationStation for Raspberry Pi</h5>
			<p>This turns any Raspi into a retro-gaming machine. Allows you to play just about
			all retro gaming consoles through your raspberry Pi.This is a fun project that you can
			also setup with NES or other type cases and utilize BT joysticks that look like
			retro controllers.

			<h5>Python Scripts and other General Command Line Tools</h5>
                        <p>I have worked and am working on many other Projects I just haven't named here yet. I also like to use Raspberry Pi as I work with Python. I have created various Pyton Scripts
			as practice. Some examples are scripts to automated photos from a Raspi Camera, Simple Remote Control Car (using a car kit with 4 wheels/motors), and still various examples.
