                I do my best to keep up with and learn new technologies, and am always working on 
                projects in my spare time to achieve this. I spent several years developing an Android Application,
                "MyHealthSheets". In order to get more familiar with other programming languages and frameworks, I have redeveloped 
                this Android App and used it as a skeleton for other projects.

                I continue working on a variety Electronics projects, and with the advent of IoT technologies have been
                able to combine my two passions of Electronics and Development. I have an arsenal of Arduino, ESP32, SMC's, and Electronics 
                Components to work with.
            </p>

                My other projects revolve around Web Servers, both on the cloud and utilizing hardware like the Raspberry Pi.
