                <li><b></b> I have been working with Web Application Technologies for over 5 years. However my experience working at Acquia has allowed me to have
                a much deeper grasp of how Web Applications and Cloud Technologies work.

                <li> I now understand how a Web Site propogates across the Internet, using DNS, CDN's, Load Balancers, Web/DB Servers.</li>
                <li> As practice, I have setup many websites using CDN, SSL, redirects, using local and Cloud Servers, running on Apache, Nginx and Kubernetes</li>
                <li>I have worked with many different Web Application Technologies and
                and languages. My most recent work has been with PHP and Javascript.</>
