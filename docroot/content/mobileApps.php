                    <li>Although I used the Android Developer Portal for Alpha and Beta testing, I never actually released it publicly. My mistake in early development was deciding to use a local database. In retrospect, I realized in order to sell the app with a paid monthly subscription I needed to use a cloud database implementation, but by this time I started working on web applications and never went back to update the app.
