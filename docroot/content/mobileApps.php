                    <li>I have built a fairly extensive Android Application from scratch. 
                    </li>
                    <li>I mostly used Google's Android Documentation to learn how to program an Android Application using best practices.
                    </li>
                    <li>This was before Google switched to Kotlin, so it was built with Java, using a SQL Database</li>
                
                    <li>Although I used the Android Developer Portal for Alpha and Beta testing, I never actually released it publicly. My mistake in early development was deciding to use a local database. In retrospect, I realized in order to sell the app with a paid monthly subscription I needed to use a cloud database implementation, but by this time I started working on forks of this project for Web Applications and haven't gone back to update the app.
